Gameplay
========
This can be triggered per player basis, or server-wide. All weapons will be turned into paintball guns, even shot guns. 
Players weapons should be regulated with another plugin.

Config
========
There is a config for the weapons that can be setup for custom weapon damages and speeds. If no damage or firerate is setup then it will use the gamedata to find the damage/firerate.
